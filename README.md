# A4

In this assignment, you will implement a linked list.

Read through the List interface defined in the a4 package and make sure you understand what each method is supposed to do.

Fill out the code in LinkedList to provide a linked list implementation of List that uses the NodeImpl implementation of the Node interface provided by us. You should not need to change Node or NodeImpl in any way. The only code you should need to provide is the code for LinkedList.
